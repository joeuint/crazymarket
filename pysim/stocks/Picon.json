    "biography": "We make computer memory chips and capitalize on every oppertunity. We would ditch our customers in a heartbeat the moment we get a chance of becoming the most valuable company for even 20 seconds. We firmly believe that short-term high growth is better than long-term steady growth. That stuff's for nerds anyways. We will jump in on any bandwagon even if we know it'll collapse just to make our stock price go up slightly higher. Yes our customers hate us, no we don't care.",
